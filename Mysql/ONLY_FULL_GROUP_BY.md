### ‚úÖ What you understood correctly

- When we use `GROUP BY`, rows with the same value (e.g., same `fname`) are put into **one bucket**.
- For that bucket, SQL should return **one row** (summary).
- If you select columns that are **not in the GROUP BY** and **not in an aggregate function**, SQL doesn‚Äôt know _which value_ from the bucket to show.
- That‚Äôs why you see the error under `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`.

---

### Example

Say we have 3 rows with `fname = Dan`:

| book_id | fname | title  | pages |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 1       | Dan   | Book A | 200   |
| 2       | Dan   | Book B | 150   |
| 3       | Dan   | Book C | 400   |

Now if you do:

```sql
SELECT fname, title FROM books GROUP BY fname;
```

üëâ MySQL says: _‚ÄúDan bucket has 3 titles. Which one should I pick? A, B, or C?‚Äù_
So ‚Üí **ERROR**.

---

### ‚úÖ Correct way

- Be **clear** with an aggregate:

```sql
SELECT fname, COUNT(*) AS total_books, MAX(pages) AS longest
FROM books
GROUP BY fname;
```

Now MySQL knows:

- `fname` = group
- `COUNT(*)` = total rows in that bucket
- `MAX(pages)` = pick the largest pages from that bucket

‚ö° **One-line memory:**
`GROUP BY` ‚Üí 1 row per group.
If you want other info ‚Üí use an **aggregate** to tell SQL _which value to pick_.
