### ✅ How `GROUP BY` Works

My thinking"
`As per what I have learned about GROUP BY, it creates a bucket for each unique combination of the grouped columns. GROUP BY works like a unique key formed from all the specified columns. For example, if I write GROUP BY fname, lname, it will create a bucket for each unique fname + lname pair. When the same key appears multiple times (e.g., "Imran Khan" exists in 3 rows), those rows are added into the same bucket, and then the query returns the aggregated result for each bucket.`

- Think of `GROUP BY` as **making buckets (groups)** based on the unique values of the columns you specify.
- Each group is like a **unique key** formed from those columns.
- Then, aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, etc.) are applied **per group (per bucket)**.

### 📌 Example Table

```text
id | fname  | lname  | marks
---+--------+--------+------
1  | Imran  | Khan   | 80
2  | Imran  | Khan   | 90
3  | Ali    | Raza   | 70
4  | Imran  | Khan   | 85
5  | Ali    | Raza   | 60
```

### 📌 Query

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, COUNT(*) AS total_rows, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY fname, lname;
```

### 📌 What Happens Internally

- MySQL **creates groups** (buckets):

  - Bucket 1: `Imran + Khan` → rows 1, 2, 4
  - Bucket 2: `Ali + Raza` → rows 3, 5

- Then it applies aggregates **inside each bucket**:

| fname | lname | total_rows | avg_marks |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| Imran | Khan  | 3          | 85.0      |
| Ali   | Raza  | 2          | 65.0      |

### ⚡ Key Points

- `GROUP BY fname, lname` = groups by the **combination** of both columns (like a composite key).
- If you group by just `fname`, then all rows with the same first name go into one bucket, regardless of `lname`.
- Without aggregate functions, `GROUP BY` just returns **unique combinations** of the grouped columns.

So your mental model of:
👉 _“unique key of all columns → make a bucket → add rows with same key into that bucket → then return what we want per bucket”_
is exactly correct ✅
